# Social-Measurement-Checkout

Social Measurement enables shopper conversion (purchase) activites to be passed back to the PowerReviews analytics platform. From this data you can gain insights such as:

* Do users who view reviews or engage reviews convert better?
* What’s the propensity of shoppers to buy products for which they’ve read reviews versus products that the shoppers did not read about? 
* Is conversion affected by the following: Number of reviews for a product | Average star rating of a product’s reviews | Number of questions for a product | Number of answers for a product | Number of answered questions for a product.

The Checkout.js also allows clients to automatically create order feeds, removing the need to maintain a nightly order feed process to send to PowerReviews for reviews solicitation.
